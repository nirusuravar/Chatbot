# Chatbot

Project Description
For this project, we have to develop a chatbot that will be able to carry out conversations with other teamsâ€™ chatbots. A chatbot is essentially a computer program that allows for humans to communicate and carry a conversation with the bot through text commands, in our situation. Chatbots utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with humans as if they are humans themselves. Users are able to communicate with chatbots as if they are talking with another human and then chatbots can interpret the words given to them and provide an answer that any normal human would. Obviously since chatbots are still bots, sometimes they say things that not everyone would say and touch on subjects that would not be brought up into a conversation otherwise. 

Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand the AI concepts behind how chatbots work. One of the applications of chatbots is to provide customer support on a website. A chatbot can be used to help customers with quick questions about a company or their product, or even just navigating through the company website. Chatbots can be trained in any way once they speak with the target audience because they learn as they keep speaking.
